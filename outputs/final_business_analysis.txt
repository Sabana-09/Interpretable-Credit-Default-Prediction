1. Executive Summary

This report provides a complete business-focused analysis of the credit default prediction model developed using the UCI Credit Card dataset. The model uses an XGBoost classifier integrated within a full preprocessing pipeline and validated with SHAP explainability techniques. The goal of this report is to explain how the model behaves from a real-world business perspective, including what drives its predictions, why it performs the way it does, where it succeeds, and where it fails. Special attention is placed on model interpretability, fairness considerations, and the potential impact on operational decision-making.

The model achieves an accuracy of 81.9%, a precision of 66.8%, a recall of 36.0%, and an ROC–AUC of 77.9%. These metrics indicate the model is effective at identifying true non-defaulters but could be improved in identifying high-risk customers who will default. Global SHAP analysis shows that recent repayment history (PAY_0) is the strongest driver of risk, while features such as LIMIT_BAL and demographic indicators (like MARRIAGE) also influence predictions. Local SHAP explanations on three real customer cases (a True Positive, True Negative, and False Positive) offer deeper insights into individual-level decision-making.

Finally, the analysis discusses fairness implications, operational risks, and threshold tuning strategies to help businesses deploy the model responsibly and effectively.

2. Business Problem Understanding

Financial institutions face substantial risk from customer loan or credit-card defaults. Early identification of customers likely to default in the upcoming billing cycle enables the organization to:

Minimize financial losses

Trigger preventive actions (e.g., reminders, negotiation, restructuring)

Adjust credit limits or interest rates

Satisfy compliance expectations around risk modeling

The prediction must be explainable and fair because credit decisions are legally regulated and audited. A black-box model without transparency would not meet business or regulatory requirements.

This project addresses this need by building a transparent, well-evaluated model and using SHAP explainability to provide insights suitable for loan officers, risk managers, and regulators.

3. Dataset and Business Context

The dataset contains 30,000 customers and 23 predictor variables, capturing:

Customer demographics

Age

Education

Sex

Marital status

These represent stable characteristics that rarely change.

Credit exposure and utilization

LIMIT_BAL

BILL_AMT1–6

PAY_AMT1–6

These indicate capacity to repay and spending behavior.

Repayment history

PAY_0

PAY_2–PAY_6

These encode whether the customer has been behind on payments.

From a business lens, repayment behavior is usually the biggest predictor of default, but demographic attributes must be treated with caution to avoid unfair bias.

4. Model Performance and What It Means for the Business
4.1 Accuracy = 81.9%

This means the model is correct for 8 out of 10 customers.
However, accuracy alone is misleading due to class imbalance (many more non-defaulters than defaulters).

4.2 Precision = 66.8%

If the model predicts a customer will default, it is correct two-thirds of the time.

Business meaning:
The organization can trust that most flagged customers are truly risky. This is good when actions based on predictions are costly (e.g., credit limit reduction).

4.3 Recall = 36.0%

The model catches only about one-third of actual defaulters.

Business meaning:

The model misses many real defaulters

This can cause real financial losses

Threshold tuning can improve recall

4.4 ROC–AUC = 77.9%

This indicates good discriminative power across thresholds.

Business meaning:

The model can be adjusted to favor recall or precision

With the right threshold, the business can optimize for loss prevention or customer retention

4.5 Summary of Business Risk

High precision = safer decisions
Low recall = many missed defaulters
Threshold tuning can shift the balance

5. Global SHAP Insights: What Drives Credit Risk

SHAP analysis reveals the key business factors driving predictions.

5.1 Most Influential Feature: PAY_0

The last month's payment behavior has the strongest influence on predicted default.

Business explanation:
If a customer missed last month's payment, the chance of default next month increases sharply.
This aligns with how financial institutions evaluate creditworthiness.

5.2 MARRIAGE

SHAP shows MARRIAGE as a surprisingly strong feature.

Business impact:

Married customers may show more stable financial behavior

BUT demographic features must be monitored for fairness

Regulators may question excessive demographic influence

5.3 LIMIT_BAL

Higher credit limits can behave differently depending on payment patterns:

High LIMIT_BAL + Good payments → low risk

High LIMIT_BAL + Poor payments → very high risk

Thus, credit limit interacts with repayment behavior.

5.4 BILL_AMT5 and BILL_AMT6

Outstanding balances from recent cycles affect score strongly.

Business meaning:
Large rolling-over balances indicate revolving credit behavior and potential liquidity problems.

5.5 PAY_AMT1

Repayment amounts reduce risk.

Business meaning:
Customers who make substantial payments demonstrate active effort to reduce debt.

6. Comparison: SHAP Global vs XGBoost Gain Importance
6.1 Agreement

Both agree that:

Recent repayment history (PAY_0) is the strongest predictor

Bills and payments in recent months matter

Credit exposure plays a role

6.2 Differences

XGBoost gain focuses heavily on:

PAY_2

PAY_3

PAY_4

PAY_5

SHAP reveals additional nuance:

MARRIAGE plays a bigger role than XGBoost gain suggests

LIMIT_BAL interacts nonlinearly with delinquency

BILL_AMT5 rises as a strong predictor

6.3 Business implication

SHAP gives a more realistic, human-explainable understanding

This is crucial for regulator audits

Businesses should rely on SHAP for customer-level explainability

7. Local SHAP Interpretations: Case-by-Case Business Insights

These explainable cases illustrate how the model behaves in real-world scenarios.

Case 1 — Customer Index 3560

Outcome: True Positive (Actual = 1, Predicted = 1)

Key risk drivers

High BILL_AMT5 (+0.3966)

High credit limit (+0.2903)

Delinquent PAY_0 (+0.2901)

Business takeaway

Customer 3560 shows active financial distress. Early interventions like:

Payment reminders

Credit limit freeze

Risk-tier monitoring

would be appropriate.

Case 2 — Customer Index 2156

Outcome: True Negative (Actual = 0, Predicted = 0)

Key protective behaviors

On-time recent payment (PAY_0 = –0.36474)

Strong credit limit (–0.32224)

High repayment amount (–0.29834)

Business takeaway

This customer is stable.
No intervention needed; they may even be a candidate for:

Credit limit increase

Lower interest rate

Positive customer relationship program

Case 3 — Customer Index 17778

Outcome: False Positive (Actual = 0, Predicted = 1)

Predicted probability: 0.5896
True label: 0
Model mistake: FP (False Positive)
Why the model erred

This customer has extremely high PAY_0 = 4 and repeated delinquencies.
However, they ultimately did not default.

Business risk

The model may over-penalize customers with historic but not ongoing delinquency

Overuse of this prediction could lead to unfair credit reduction

Recommendation

Use SHAP explanations for human review before taking action on customers flagged near the borderline (probabilities 0.5–0.65).

(Fairness, Threshold Tuning, Business Decisions, Recommendations)

8. Fairness and Ethical Considerations

Credit scoring systems are monitored closely by regulators.
Two fairness risks were identified:

8.1 Use of MARRIAGE as a Top Feature

Although SHAP reveals MARRIAGE has partial predictive value, this may lead to:

Disparate impact on unmarried individuals

Questions about demographic bias

Regulatory scrutiny

Recommendation:
Regularly monitor false positive/negative rates across demographic groups.

8.2 Over-Reliance on Past Delinquency

Many customers temporarily fall behind but recover.
Case 17778 shows how repeated delinquencies can dominate predictions even when the customer eventually pays.

Recommendation:
Incorporate additional features:

Income

Total assets

Employment stability

This reduces structural bias.

9. Threshold Tuning: A Key Lever for Business Performance

The default XGBoost threshold of 0.5 gives high precision but low recall.

Option A: Increase recall (lower threshold)

Lower threshold → identify more defaulters
Useful when goal = reduce losses

Option B: Increase precision (raise threshold)

Raise threshold → fewer false positives
Useful when goal = retain customers and avoid unnecessary credit reduction

Optimal Strategy

Use a dual-threshold system:

High-risk customers: automatic actions

Medium-risk customers: manual review assisted by SHAP

Low-risk customers: maintain normal operations

10. Operational Recommendations

Deploy model + SHAP dashboards
Loan officers should see individual SHAP explanations before making decisions.

Monitor FP/FN cases monthly
Track model errors to refine risk policies.

Re-train quarterly
Credit behavior patterns shift rapidly; retraining keeps model accurate.

Perform fairness audits
Ensure demographic variables are not causing unintended discrimination.

Use human-in-the-loop decisioning
Especially for borderline cases (prob 0.45–0.65).

11. Model Limitations

Lack of income or employment data

Over-reliance on PAY_X variables

No external credit bureau data

Delayed payments may not always reflect true risk

Demographic features might introduce bias

12. Final Conclusion

The credit default prediction model performs well and provides reliable, transparent insights into customer behavior. SHAP explainability reveals the key drivers of risk, and the combination of global and local insights provides a solid foundation for both operational decision-making and regulatory compliance.

While the model has strong precision and a robust ROC–AUC, its recall can be improved with threshold tuning or by expanding the dataset. Ethical and fairness considerations must remain central to its deployment, especially when demographic features like MARRIAGE appear influential.

Overall, the model is suitable for real-world use when paired with human oversight and SHAP-based interpretability tools. It offers a strong balance of predictive power, transparency, and business usefulness.
