Final Business Analysis (Actionable Insights and Fairness Evaluation)

Model performance:
The model achieved Accuracy = 0.819, Precision = 0.668, Recall = 0.360, F1 = 0.468, and ROC-AUC = 0.780. High precision indicates the model rarely mislabels safe customers as defaulters, which is desirable in lending. The lower recall means some true defaulters are missed, suggesting opportunity for threshold adjustment depending on business risk tolerance.

Key global drivers (quantified with SHAP):
- num__PAY_0 (recent payment status) is the strongest global driver. In one customer (index 17778), PAY_0 alone contributed +1.21899 toward default risk, showing its dominant role.
- num__LIMIT_BAL and BILL_AMT5 reinforce credit utilization signals. Example: BILL_AMT5 added +0.3966 for customer 3560.
- num__MARRIAGE consistently influences predictions (e.g., –0.56125 for customer 17778), indicating demographic structure learned by the model.

Local interpretability:
- Customer 3560: Mixed profile with both high balances and repayment behavior. SHAP shows moderate upward risk (+0.3966 from BILL_AMT5).
- Customer 17778: High-risk case dominated by PAY_0 (over +1.21 influence). Decision strongly justified.
- Customer 2156: Low-risk profile with substantial negative SHAP contributions (–0.36474 PAY_0, –0.32224 LIMIT_BAL).

Fairness considerations:
MARRIAGE appears as a top feature, meaning demographic characteristics influence predictions. This requires group-level fairness monitoring to ensure no disproportionate error rates. Regulators expect justification when demographic attributes affect outcomes. Lenders should compute precision, recall, and false-positive rates across marital-status groups regularly and adjust thresholds or reweight data if disparities appear.

Business recommendations:
1. Use the model as a decision-support tool with human oversight for high-SHAP PAY_0 cases.
2. Consider threshold tuning to increase recall if reducing default losses is a priority.
3. Integrate SHAP explanations into customer risk dashboards.
4. Implement fairness monitoring pipelines to evaluate demographic impacts (starting with MARRIAGE).

Conclusion:
This XGBoost-SHAP system provides transparent, regulation-ready credit default prediction. The numeric SHAP values make model decisions explainable, supporting responsible and fair lending operationally.
