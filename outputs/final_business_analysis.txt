Final Business Analysis — Credit Default Model (XGBoost + SHAP)

1. Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to interpret the credit default prediction model from a business and risk-management perspective. The model uses XGBoost and SHAP explainability to assess customer default risk.

2. Performance Summary
- Accuracy: 0.819  
- Precision: 0.6685  
- Recall: 0.3602  
- F1: 0.4682  
- ROC–AUC: 0.7797  

Interpretation:
The model is reliable for identifying non-defaulters but misses many true defaulters.

3. Global Feature Insights
The model relies heavily on:  
- PAY_0  
- LIMIT_BAL  
- BILL_AMT5  
- MARRIAGE  
- PAY_AMT1  

PAY_0 is the strongest predictor both in XGBoost gain (f6 = 339.11) and SHAP.

4. Local SHAP Interpretation

Customer 3560 (TP):  
Large positive SHAP: BILL_AMT5 (+0.39), LIMIT_BAL (+0.29), PAY_0 (+0.28).  
Conclusion: High risk confirmed.

Customer 2156 (TN):  
Strong negative SHAP: PAY_0 (–0.36), LIMIT_BAL (–0.31), PAY_AMT1 (–0.29).  
Conclusion: Low risk.

Customer 17778 (FP):  
Positive SHAP: PAY_0 (+1.23), PAY_2 (+0.26), PAY_6 (+0.25).  
Protective: MARRIAGE (–0.52).  
Conclusion: Over-penalized due to historical delinquency.

5. Fairness Considerations
MARRIAGE appears frequently in top SHAP features. This requires monitoring to ensure demographic fairness.

6. Recommendations
- Add human review for borderline scores (0.55–0.8)  
- Track FP and FN rates monthly  
- Monitor demographic fairness  
- Consider expanding features (income, employment status)  
- Adjust threshold to increase recall if business wants to reduce missed defaults  

This analysis provides a business-centered interpretation of the model's behavior supported by numeric SHAP evidence.
