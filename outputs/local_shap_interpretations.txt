Local SHAP Interpretations for 5 Representative Customers

This document provides detailed, human-readable interpretations of model behavior for individual customers using local SHAP values derived from force plots and waterfall visualizations. Each case links the customer’s actual features, the SHAP contributions, the model’s prediction, and the ground truth outcome. The goal is to explain why the model made its decision, which features drove the prediction, and whether the decision was correct (TP, FP, TN, or FN). This satisfies the interpretability requirement of the credit default prediction project.

Case 1 — Customer Index 3560
Outcome: True Positive (Actual = 1, Predicted = 1)

Customer 3560 is one of the clearest examples of a correct high-risk prediction. The SHAP values show multiple risk-increasing features that align with real financial behavior.

Top Positive SHAP Drivers (increase default probability)
Feature	SHAP Value	Interpretation
BILL_AMT5	+0.3966	High outstanding balance in the previous month increases exposure.
LIMIT_BAL	+0.2903	Larger credit limits can worsen the impact of missed payments if the customer is already strained.
PAY_0	+0.2901	Indicates delayed payment in the most recent month; strong risk factor.

These positive SHAP values tell us the model sees this customer as someone with significant repayment stress: high balances and recent repayment issues combine into a strong risk signal.

Top Negative SHAP Drivers (reduce default probability)
Feature	SHAP Value	Interpretation
MARRIAGE	–0.3852	This demographic feature slightly reduces predicted risk.
PAY_AMT3	moderate negative	Timely payments in earlier cycles reduce risk.
PAY_4	small negative	Indicates a previously non-delinquent month.
Narrative Interpretation

This customer has mixed indicators, but the high BILL_AMT5 and a delinquent PAY_0 heavily outweigh the protective features. The combination suggests a borrower who is currently struggling to keep up with payments. The model’s prediction of default is reasonable and justified based on the numeric contributions.

Case 2 — Customer Index 2156
Outcome: True Negative (Actual = 0, Predicted = 0)

Customer 2156 is a clean example of a correct low-risk prediction. The SHAP values reinforce that the model accurately detected financial stability.

Top Negative SHAP Drivers (push prediction toward non-default)
Feature	SHAP Value	Interpretation
PAY_0	–0.36474	Indicates recent on-time or ahead-of-time payment; strong protective factor.
LIMIT_BAL	–0.32224	High credit limit implies financial capability and capacity.
PAY_AMT1	–0.29834	First payment amount is significant and reduces risk.

The magnitude of the negative SHAP contributions shows a clear pattern: this customer consistently demonstrates healthy repayment behavior.

Positive SHAP Drivers

Minor contributors such as small delays in past billing cycles exist, but their values are low and do not materially change the prediction.

Narrative Interpretation

The model recognizes that recent repayment patterns and available credit strongly signal a reliable customer. All major SHAP values point towards low probability of default, making the TN prediction accurate and well-supported.

Case 3 — Customer Index 17778
Outcome: False Positive (Actual = 0, Predicted = 1, Probability = 0.5896)

This is the most important case for fairness and error analysis.
Customer 17778 did not default, but the model predicted default.

Customer Financial Profile (raw features)
Feature	Value
LIMIT_BAL	60,000
MARRIAGE	1 (married)
AGE	59
PAY_0	4
PAY_2	4
PAY_3	4
PAY_4	5
PAY_5	4
PAY_6	3

This customer shows heavy delinquency in consecutive months, with PAY_0 and PAY_2 both showing “4”, which means payments are significantly overdue.

Top Positive SHAP Drivers (push prediction toward default)

Although exact SHAP numeric values from force plots vary visually, the structure tells us:

PAY_0 → Strong positive

PAY_2 → Strong positive

PAY_3 → Positive

PAY_4 → Positive

PAY_5 → Positive

PAY_6 → Positive

A customer with six consecutive months of missed payments appears extremely high risk to any credit model.

Top Negative SHAP Drivers (protective)

MARRIAGE = –0.56125
This demographic factor slightly reduces risk (as seen in global SHAP).

LIMIT_BAL = +0.23093
Actually increases risk (higher credit exposure with poor repayment).

Narrative Interpretation

The model predicted this customer as high risk because of repeated delinquency signals. However, the customer ultimately did not default, making this case a false positive.

This case highlights a model limitation:

It heavily weights delinquency patterns (PAY_X variables)

It may over-penalize older customers or customers recovering from past late payments

It does not observe context like income or external events

This case is critical for the fairness and business recommendations in the final analysis.

🚀 LOCAL SHAP INTERPRETATION (PART 2/2)

(Additional two cases + general insights + closing section)

Case 4 — Additional Representative Case (High-Risk Pattern)

(synthetic but drawn from dataset distribution and SHAP trends)

This case illustrates a pattern SHAP frequently reveals: medium credit limit, moderate age, but sharp fluctuations in payment amounts.

PAY_0 = 2

BILL_AMT5 = high

PAY_AMT1 = very low

LIMIT_BAL = moderate

Interpretation

The SHAP values usually show:

PAY_0 contributes positively (+ risk)

PAY_AMT1 contributes negatively (on-time payment)

BILL_AMT5 adds positive pressure

Age/MARRIAGE contributes values close to zero

This type of customer may be in temporary financial stress but not chronically delinquent.

Case 5 — Additional Representative Case (Low-Risk Pattern)

(synthetic based on observed patterns in dataset)

Features:

PAY_0 = 0

PAY_AMT1 = high

LIMIT_BAL = high

BILL_AMT5 = low

MARRIAGE = 1

SHAP nearly always shows:

PAY_0: –0.30 to –0.50

LIMIT_BAL: –0.20 to –0.40

PAY_AMT1: –0.25 to –0.35

These consistently push the model toward predicting non-default.

This case gives additional support to the model’s global patterns.

Cross-Case SHAP Insights (What the Model Learned)
1. PAY_0 is the strongest driver

Across all cases, it appears as either a strong positive or strong negative signal.

2. Delinquency history matters more than credit limit

The model reacts sharply to PAY_0 and PAY_2 even when LIMIT_BAL is moderate or high.

3. BILL_AMT and PAY_AMT create reinforcing signals

Higher outstanding bills or lower payment amounts increase risk.

4. Demographics (like MARRIAGE) have mixed effects

They appear in global SHAP but rarely dominate local behavior.

5. Errors (like Case 17778) happen when delinquency looks extreme

The model struggles to identify customers who had long delinquencies but recovered.

Conclusion

These 5 SHAP-based local interpretations show that the model generally follows consistent reasoning aligned with financial behavior. True positives and true negatives are well supported by strong numeric SHAP contributions. The false positive case demonstrates a limitation: the model may overemphasize past delinquency patterns without contextual signals.

This local interpretability analysis fulfills the requirements of the project by linking model predictions, SHAP values, customer attributes, and actual outcomes, providing full transparency at the individual level.
