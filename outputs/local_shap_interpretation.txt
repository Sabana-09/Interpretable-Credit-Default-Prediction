Local SHAP Interpretations — Three Representative Cases
(Positive SHAP = pushes toward default; Negative SHAP = pushes away.)

Case A — Index 3560
- Top positive contributors:
  * num__BILL_AMT5 = +0.3966 
  * num__LIMIT_BAL = +0.2903
  * num__PAY_0      = +0.2901
- Top negative contributors:
  * num__MARRIAGE   = –0.3852
  * num__PAY_4      = small negative
  * num__PAY_AMT3   = moderate negative
Summary:
This customer has high past balances and recent payment issues, creating upward risk pressure. Demographic (MARRIAGE) and earlier timely payments reduce risk.

Case B — Index 17778
- Top positive contributors:
  * num__PAY_0      = +1.21899
  * num__PAY_2      = +0.2433
  * num__PAY_6      = +0.2352
- Top negative contributors:
  * num__MARRIAGE   = –0.56125
  * num__LIMIT_BAL  = +0.23093 (positive but smaller than PAY_0)
  * num__PAY_3      = small negative
Summary:
PAY_0 massively dominates this decision, creating a very strong risk signal. Protective features cannot overcome this high delinquency impact.

Case C — Index 2156
- Top protective contributors (largest negatives):
  * num__PAY_0      = –0.36474
  * num__LIMIT_BAL  = –0.32224
  * num__PAY_AMT1   = –0.29834
Summary:
For this individual, recent payment status and repayment amounts lower predicted default risk. The model views them as relatively stable.
