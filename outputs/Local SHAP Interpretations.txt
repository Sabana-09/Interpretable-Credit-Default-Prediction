Local SHAP Interpretations for Three Representative Cases

This section provides detailed explanations for three individual credit applicants using SHAP local (force/waterfall) explanations. Each case highlights how specific features contributed to pushing the prediction toward or away from default.

Case 1 — Index 3560

For this customer, the model’s prediction was influenced by a mix of moderate-impact positive and negative factors. The strongest contributors pushing the prediction toward default were BILL_AMT5, LIMIT_BAL, and PAY_0. A high amount in BILL_AMT5 indicates substantial outstanding balances several months prior, suggesting persistent debt. A higher credit limit (LIMIT_BAL) can sometimes reflect higher financial exposure, increasing perceived risk when paired with other risk factors. Additionally, a positive PAY_0 value (recent delayed payment) contributed to the risk signal.

Conversely, the main features pushing the prediction away from default were MARRIAGE, PAY_4, and PAY_AMT3. The negative contribution of MARRIAGE suggests that this customer falls into a marital category associated historically with lower default risk in this dataset. PAY_4 reductions and higher past payments (PAY_AMT3) demonstrate repayment effort, lowering risk. Overall, the model balanced mixed signals, resulting in a moderate risk score.

Case 2 — Index 17778

This customer showed extremely strong signals pushing the model toward default, dominated almost entirely by PAY_0 (+1.25), with smaller contributions from PAY_2 and PAY_6. The magnitude of the PAY_0 SHAP value indicates a recent significant repayment delay, which the model interprets as the strongest known predictor of future default.

On the other hand, risk-reducing factors included MARRIAGE, LIMIT_BAL, and PAY_3, which partially offset risk. MARRIAGE again acted as a demographic stabilizer. A higher credit limit and past successful repayments (PAY_3) provided evidence of financial stability. However, these negative SHAP values were not strong enough to compensate for the very large positive influence of PAY_0. The model’s decision for this case is strongly justified by repayment delinquency.

Case 3 — Index 2156

This customer’s prediction was shaped by risk-increasing signals from PAY_0, LIMIT_BAL, and PAY_AMT1, all of which contributed positively to default likelihood. A delayed recent payment (PAY_0) remains a central driver, while LIMIT_BAL reflects the risk associated with higher credit exposure. PAY_AMT1’s positive contribution suggests inconsistent or insufficient recent repayment amounts.

The strongest protective (default-reducing) features were PAY_AMT3, PAY_AMT5, and PAY_AMT2, each representing active repayment behavior in earlier periods. These negative SHAP values indicate the customer has a reasonable history of making payments, which counterbalances recent risk signals. The model’s final risk assessment thus emerges from a combination of strong short-term concerns and longer-term payment patterns.
