PROJECT: Interpretable ML - SHAP Analysis of Credit Risk

Brief approach:
1. Preprocessed numeric features (median imputation + scaling) and categorical features (most-frequent imputation + one-hot).
2. Trained an XGBoost classifier with hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV) optimizing f1.
3. Evaluated model on test set using accuracy, F1, precision, recall and ROC-AUC (when available).
4. Compared model-specific feature importance with SHAP global summary and generated local SHAP explanations for 3-5 representative loans.
