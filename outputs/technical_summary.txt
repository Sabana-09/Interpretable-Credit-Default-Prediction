Technical Summary of Model Development, Tuning, and Interpretability

This document summarizes the full machine-learning workflow used to build a credit default prediction model using the UCI Credit Card dataset. The steps include preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, performance evaluation, and interpretability using SHAP values. The goal is to create a transparent, auditable model suitable for business use and regulatory review.

1. Dataset
The dataset consists of 30,000 credit card clients with 23 predictor variables including demographics, payment history, bill amounts, credit limits, and repayment amounts. The target variable is “default.payment.next.month.”

2. Preprocessing Strategy
Numeric variables (LIMIT_BAL, BILL_AMT1–6, PAY_AMT1–6, PAY_0–PAY_6, AGE) were imputed using median values and scaled. Categorical features (SEX, EDUCATION, MARRIAGE) were imputed with the mode and encoded using OneHotEncoder with handle_unknown='ignore'. A ColumnTransformer combined these into a unified preprocessing pipeline.

3. Model Pipeline
The model pipeline uses:
- ColumnTransformer for preprocessing
- XGBClassifier as the estimator
- GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning

The final best hyperparameters were:
- n_estimators = 100
- max_depth = 6
- learning_rate = 0.1

4. Performance Metrics
On the 6,000-row test set, the model achieved:
- Accuracy = 0.819
- Precision = 0.6685
- Recall = 0.3602
- F1 score = 0.4682
- ROC–AUC = 0.7797

Interpretation:
The model performs well for identifying non-default cases (precision is high), but recall is lower, meaning many true defaults are missed.

5. Global Feature Importance

5.1 XGBoost Gain Importance
Extracted from the booster:

f0: 6.89  
f1: 21.43  
f2: 7.55  
f3: 10.00  
f4: 6.45  
f5: 7.05  
f6: 339.11  
f7: 94.53  
f8: 44.56  
f9: 39.62  
f10: 38.02  
f11: 34.26  
f12: 15.12  
f13: 8.77  
f14: 8.52  
f15: 8.15  
f16: 6.32  
f17: 8.42  
f18: 12.91  
f19: 25.78  
f20: 21.16  
f21: 11.78  
f22: 10.08  
f23: 11.89

The highest contributor (f6 ≈ 339.11) maps to num__PAY_0.

5.2 SHAP Global Summary
Top SHAP features were:
1. num__PAY_0
2. num__MARRIAGE
3. num__LIMIT_BAL
4. num__BILL_AMT5
5. num__PAY_AMT1

SHAP reveals directional effects and interactions that gain importance cannot.

6. Local SHAP Summary (Full details in local_shap_interpretation)
Case 3560 (TP): Large positive effects from BILL_AMT5 (+0.39), LIMIT_BAL (+0.29), PAY_0 (+0.28).  
Case 2156 (TN): Strong negative contributions from PAY_0 (–0.36), LIMIT_BAL (–0.31), PAY_AMT1 (–0.29).  
Case 17778 (FP): Large positive PAY_0 value (+1.23), but true label was 0.

7. Limitations and Recommendations
The model focuses heavily on delinquency variables and sometimes over-penalizes customers with past payment issues but who later recover. MARRIAGE's influence must be monitored for fairness. Threshold tuning could improve recall.

This concludes the technical summary for the model development process.
