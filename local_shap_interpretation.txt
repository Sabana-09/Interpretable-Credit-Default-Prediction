Local SHAP Interpretations — Three Representative Cases

This document describes local SHAP explanations for three customers, selected to demonstrate how the model reasons about individual predictions.

CASE 1 — Customer 3560  
Outcome: True Positive  
True label = 1, Predicted = 1  
Key SHAP values:  
- BILL_AMT5: +0.39  
- LIMIT_BAL: +0.29  
- PAY_0: +0.28  
- PAY_4: +0.21  
- PAY_AMT3: +0.14  
- MARRIAGE: –0.36  

Interpretation:
High recent bill amounts and a delayed recent payment push risk upward. MARRIAGE provides a protective effect but is not strong enough to counter the positive signals.

CASE 2 — Customer 2156  
Outcome: True Negative  
True label = 0, Predicted = 0  
Key SHAP values:  
- PAY_0: –0.36  
- LIMIT_BAL: –0.31  
- PAY_AMT1: –0.29  
Other payment amounts also contribute small negative values.

Interpretation:
The model sees consistent recent payments and a healthy credit limit as strong stabilizing factors.

CASE 3 — Customer 17778  
Outcome: False Positive  
True label = 0, Predicted = 1  
Prediction probability = 0.5896  
Key SHAP values:  
- PAY_0: +1.23  
- PAY_2: +0.26  
- PAY_6: +0.25  
- LIMIT_BAL: +0.24  
- MARRIAGE: –0.52  

Interpretation:
The model heavily penalizes the repeated delinquency patterns and overestimates risk. Despite strong protective SHAP from MARRIAGE, the sum of positive contributions makes the model predict default incorrectly.

These local analyses show where the model is reliable and where it should be supplemented with human review.
